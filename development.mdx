<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:
  - Rust toolchain (latest stable)
  - Git for version control
</Info>

Follow these steps to set up dx for local development.

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the repository">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dx-cli/dx.git
cd dx
```
</Step>

<Step title="Build and install locally">

Use the included install script for development builds:

```bash
# Build and install to ~/.local/bin (recommended)
./install.sh

# Uninstall
./uninstall.sh
```

The install script builds the project in release mode and copies the binary to `~/.local/bin/dx`.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Development workflow

dx includes a built-in development menu accessible via the `dx.yaml` configuration:

```bash
# Build and install dx
dx build.install

# Run tests
dx test

# Run clippy for linting
dx clippy
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
cargo test
```

dx includes several test modules:
- `tests/exit_codes.rs` - Exit code handling tests
- `tests/motd_asciinema_menu_markdown.rs` - MOTD and markdown tests  
- `tests/checks_and_router.rs` - Menu and routing tests

## Code structure

The dx codebase is organized as follows:

- `src/main.rs` - Main entry point and CLI argument parsing
- `src/menu.rs` - Menu system and item handling
- `src/exec.rs` - Command execution and PTY management
- `src/markdown.rs` - Markdown rendering
- `src/asciinema.rs` - Recording and streaming integration
- `src/config.rs` - Configuration management
- `src/screens/` - TUI screen implementations

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3. Make your changes and add tests
4. Run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` to check for issues
5. Run `cargo test` to ensure all tests pass
6. Submit a pull request

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Build fails">
    Make sure you have the latest stable Rust toolchain:
    
    ```bash
    rustup update stable
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Binary not found after install">
    Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH:
    
    ```bash
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission denied">
    If you get permission errors, the install script will automatically fall back to `~/.local/bin` instead of system-wide installation.
