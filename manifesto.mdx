**Development should be straightforward and productive.**

Many developers spend significant time on setup and configuration tasks:

- Figuring out different installation processes for each project
- Remembering command-line options for tools used occasionally
- Looking up setup instructions from various sources
- Working with different package managers and build systems
- Explaining project setup to new team members


## Problems DX tries to solve

### Complex Setup Processes
Setting up development environments often involves juggling multiple installers, resolving dependency conflicts, and following lengthy setup guides that vary between projects.

### Command-Line Friction
Many development tools require memorizing specific flags and arguments, creating barriers for both new team members and occasional users.

### Scattered Documentation
Project knowledge often lives in different places - wikis, README files, team chat messages - making it hard for developers to find what they need quickly.

## Our Approach

**Simple workflow management for development teams.**

dx makes it easier to:
- Share project setups across teams
- Onboard new developers quickly  
- Standardize common tasks
- Keep documentation close to code

## Design Principles

### Easy to Start
- Works without complex configuration
- Visual interface for common tasks
- One-click setup where possible

### Easy to Share
- Simple config files anyone can read
- Workflows transfer between projects
- Team knowledge stays in the repository

### Easy to Extend
- Power users can script everything
- Beginners get guided interfaces
- No vendor lock-in - standard formats everywhere
