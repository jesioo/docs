> Before we chase superintelligence, let's conquer keystrokes. Speech-to-text and agents paved the way; we'll push it further.

## Our Vision

**What Cursor is for professional coding, and Bolt/Lovable are for vibe‑coding, dx aspires to be for the terminal: a fast, trustworthy runner that turns docs into do‑ables.**

The terminal remains the most powerful interface for developers, yet it's often the most fragmented part of our workflow. While we build sophisticated AI coding assistants, our terminal experience remains stuck in decades-old patterns of scattered scripts, inconsistent commands, and tribal knowledge.

dx changes this.

## The Problem We're Solving

### Fragmented Developer Experience
- Every project has different commands, scripts, and conventions
- New team members spend days learning "how things work here"
- Documentation lives in wikis, READMEs, and people's heads
- AI agents struggle with inconsistent command interfaces

### Terminal Friction  
- No standard way to organize project workflows
- Commands buried in obscure scripts and makefiles
- Knowledge transfer happens through Slack messages and screen shares
- Debugging requires deep tribal knowledge

### AI Integration Gap
- Current tools weren't designed for AI-first workflows
- No semantic command discovery for agents
- Inconsistent interfaces across projects
- Manual processes that should be automated

## Our Solution

### dx: The AI-Native Terminal Experience

**Zero-Setup Onboarding**  
Open any repo, get a guided menu and contextual MOTD. No complex setup, no learning curve.

**One File to Rule Them All**  
`menu.toml/yaml/json` drives tasks, demos, runbooks. Simple, transparent, version-controlled.

**AI-First Design**  
Built from the ground up for AI agents with semantic aliases, non-interactive modes, and predictable interfaces.

**Security & Transparency**  
Inspectable installer, plain-text configs, no daemons, no root required. Trust through transparency.

## The AI-Native Future

We believe the future of development tooling is AI-native. Not AI-integrated, not AI-enhanced, but **AI-native**:

- **Predictable interfaces** that AI agents can rely on across any project
- **Semantic commands** that carry meaning, not just functionality  
- **Recording & learning** from every interaction to continuously improve
- **Self-documenting workflows** that explain themselves to both humans and AI

## Why Now?

The terminal is ready for its AI moment:

1. **AI coding assistants** are becoming mainstream
2. **Remote work** demands better knowledge transfer
3. **Complexity** of modern development stacks needs structure  
4. **Standardization** is essential for AI agent effectiveness

## Our Principles

dx is built on fundamental principles that guide every design decision:

- **Simplicity over complexity** - One config file beats scattered scripts
- **Transparency over magic** - Plain text configs, inspectable everything
- **AI-first thinking** - Designed for both humans and AI agents
- **Zero vendor lock-in** - Your configs work everywhere
- **Security by design** - Trust through transparency and minimal privilege

## The Terminal Renaissance

We're not just building a tool - we're participating in the **terminal renaissance**. 

As AI transforms how we write code, the terminal becomes the **command center** for AI-human collaboration. dx ensures this command center is:

- **Structured** - Organized workflows instead of scattered commands
- **Intelligent** - AI-native design for seamless automation  
- **Accessible** - Documentation becomes interactive guidance
- **Reliable** - Consistent experience across all projects

## Join the Movement

dx is open source because terminal excellence should belong to everyone. Whether you're:

- **A developer** tired of remembering different commands across projects
- **A team lead** wanting consistent onboarding for new members  
- **An AI researcher** building the next generation of coding assistants
- **A platform engineer** standardizing developer workflows

You're part of the **terminal renaissance**.
