# dx - Terminal DX Documentation

This repository contains the public documentation for **dx**, a fast, trustworthy terminal runner that turns docs into do-ables.

**dx** is a developer-first CLI/TUI that transforms your README, runbooks, and scripts into a focused terminal experience. What Cursor is for professional coding, and Bolt/Lovable are for vibe-coding, dx aspires to be for the terminal.

**[Get started with dx](https://docs.dx.sh/quickstart)**

## Key Features

- **Zero-setup onboarding**: Open a repo, get a guided menu and MOTD
- **One file to rule them all**: `menu.toml/yaml/json` drives tasks, demos, runbooks  
- **Security & transparency**: Inspectable installer, plain-text menus, no daemons
- **Built-in recording**: Asciinema integration for recording or live streaming
- **Hybrid output**: Colors, spinner, timer, auto-scroll, markdown toggles
- **AI integration**: Built-in support for Cursor and other development tools
