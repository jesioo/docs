dx is designed with security and transparency as core principles, providing a safe terminal experience without compromising functionality.

## Security by Design

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="No Root Required" icon="user-shield">
    Installs and runs entirely in user space without privileged access
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Daemons" icon="server">
    Single binary with no background processes or system services
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transparent Installer" icon="eye">
    Inspectable installation script hosted on public repositories
  </Card>
  <Card title="Plain Text Config" icon="file-text">
    All configurations in readable TOML/YAML/JSON formats
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Installation Security

### Inspectable Installer
The dx installer is completely transparent:

```bash
# View the installer before running
curl -s https://usedx.sh/install | less

# Or inspect directly on GitHub
# https://github.com/dx-cli/dx/blob/main/install.sh
```

### No Privilege Escalation
- Falls back to `~/.local/bin` when sudo unavailable
- Never requires root access to function
- Respects user permissions and environment

### Integrity Verification
- SHA256 checksum verification for all downloads
- Signed releases with verification instructions
- Deterministic builds for reproducibility

## Runtime Security

### Process Isolation
```toml
# Commands run in isolated processes
[[items]]
name = "Safe Command"
cmd = "echo 'This runs safely in isolation'"
```

### Explicit Confirmations
dx requires explicit user confirmation for potentially destructive actions:

- **Process Termination** - Ctrl+C shows kill confirmation
- **File Operations** - Clear prompts for file modifications  
- **External Commands** - Visual distinction for shell escapes
- **Configuration Changes** - Confirmation for sensitive settings

### Input Sanitization
- Command injection protection
- Path traversal prevention  
- Environment variable validation
- User input escaping

## Configuration Security

### Plain Text Transparency
All dx configurations are stored in readable text formats:

```toml
# config.toml - completely transparent
[telemetry]
enabled = false          # Clearly visible opt-in
endpoint = "https://..."

[asciinema] 
enabled = true
external = false         # Explicit external access control
```

### Local vs Global Separation
```
~/.dx/config.toml        # Global user settings
./config.toml            # Project-specific overrides
```

- Clear separation of scope and permissions
- Project configs cannot modify global settings
- Override controls with `allow_project_override`

## Process Control

### Safe Command Execution
dx provides multiple layers of process safety:

<ResponseField name="Visible Commands" type="safety">
  All commands are displayed before execution with full command line visible
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Kill Protection" type="safety">
  Process termination requires explicit confirmation to prevent accidental kills
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="External Mode Safety" type="safety">
  External shell commands clearly indicated with pause prompts and return confirmations
</ResponseField>

### Environment Protection
- Commands inherit limited environment variables
- No automatic PATH manipulation  
- Explicit working directory control
- Process group isolation

## Network Security

### Optional Telemetry
Telemetry is completely optional and transparent:

```toml
[telemetry]
enabled = false          # Default: disabled
endpoint = "https://..."  # Clearly visible destination
```

- Disabled by default
- Only sends failed command logs when enabled
- Clear endpoint visibility
- Easy to disable at any time

### Recording Privacy
Asciinema integration respects privacy:

- Local recordings by default
- Streaming requires explicit configuration
- No automatic uploads
- Clear recording status indicators

## File System Safety

### Read-Only by Default
dx operates in read-only mode for most operations:
- Menu files are read-only
- MOTD files are display-only
- Configuration changes require explicit user action

### Limited File Access
- Only accesses files in current directory and subdirectories
- No automatic system file access
- Respects file permissions and ownership

## Best Practices

### Secure Configuration
```toml
# Recommended secure defaults
[asciinema]
enabled = false          # Only enable when needed

[telemetry]  
enabled = false          # Opt-in only

[update]
on_start = false         # Manual updates only
```

### Menu Security
```toml
# Safe menu practices
[[items]]
name = "Safe Build"
description = "Build with explicit output"
cmd = "cargo build --verbose"  # Verbose for transparency
external = false               # Keep inside dx for control
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Set secure environment
export DX_LOG_LEVEL=info    # Control logging verbosity
export DX_CONFIG_DIR=~/.dx  # Explicit config location
```

<Tip>
  Regular security updates are distributed through the same transparent installation mechanism.

<Note>
  dx maintains detailed security documentation and welcomes security research. See our security policy for responsible disclosure guidelines.
</Note>

<Warning>
  While dx itself is secure, always review the commands and scripts you configure in your menus.
