dx provides sophisticated command execution capabilities with full terminal emulation, interactive input, and safe process management.

## Execution Modes

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Internal Mode" icon="window">
    Commands run inside dx TUI with full output capture and control
  </Card>
  <Card title="External Mode" icon="external-link">
    Commands run in your shell, then return to dx interface
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Internal Mode (Default)
```toml
[[items]]
name = "Build Project"
cmd = "cargo build --release"
external = false  # Default behavior
```

- Full PTY integration for terminal apps
- Real-time ANSI color output  
- Interactive stdin support
- Process control with confirmations

### External Mode  
```toml
[[items]]
name = "Open Editor"
cmd = "code ."
external = true   # Drops to shell temporarily
```

- Runs in your native shell environment
- Full TTY access for complex applications
- Automatic return to dx interface
- Pause prompt for short-running commands

## Real-Time Output Features

### Visual Indicators
- **Animated spinners** during command execution
- **Live timers** showing execution duration  
- **Process status** with colored exit codes
- **Progress feedback** for long-running tasks

### ANSI Support
dx preserves full ANSI color sequences and terminal formatting:

```bash
# Colors, bold, italic, underline all preserved
echo -e "\033[31mError:\033[0m \033[1mBold text\033[0m"
```

## Interactive Input

<ResponseField name="Standard Input" type="feature">
  Full stdin support for interactive commands like prompts, passwords, and user input
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Terminal Emulation" type="feature">
  PTY integration automatically detects and handles TUI applications 
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Signal Handling" type="feature">
  Proper forwarding of Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z, and other terminal signals
</ResponseField>

## Process Control & Safety

### Safe Kill Confirmation
When you press `Ctrl+C` during command execution:

1. dx shows a confirmation modal
2. Press `Enter` to kill the process
3. Press `Esc` to cancel and continue

### Exit Status Handling
Commands complete with clear status indicators:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Success** - Exit code 0 with green indicator
- ðŸ”´ **Error** - Non-zero exit with red indicator  
- ðŸŸ¡ **Terminated** - Process killed with yellow indicator

## Advanced Features

### Environment Variables
Commands inherit your shell environment plus dx-specific variables:

```bash
# Available in all commands
echo "Menu: $DX_MENU_NAME"
echo "Item: $DX_ITEM_NAME"  
```

### Working Directory
Commands execute in the directory where dx was launched, with full access to:
- Project files and directories
- Git repository context
- Local configurations

### Output Capture
All command output is captured and can be:
- Scrolled through with full history
- Searched and filtered
- Exported or shared via recordings

<Tip>
  Use `external = true` for commands that need full shell features like job control, complex piping, or shell-specific syntax.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Interactive password prompts work best with `external = false` mode for security and proper terminal handling.
</Warning>
