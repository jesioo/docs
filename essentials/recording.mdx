## Quick Recording

### Command Line Recording
Record specific commands directly:

```bash
dx build --record        # Record the build command
dx deploy --record       # Record deployment process
```

### Interactive Session Recording  
Start recording with live streaming:

```bash
dx --live               # Start live streaming session
dx --record             # Start recording session
```

## Configuration

### Basic Setup
```toml
# config.toml
[asciinema]
enabled = true
external = true          # Record external commands too
dir = "./recordings"     # Output directory  
file_prefix = "session"  # Filename prefix
quiet = true            # Suppress prompts
overwrite = true        # Overwrite existing files
```

### Live Streaming Setup
```toml  
[asciinema]
enabled = true
stream = true           # Enable streaming mode
stream_mode = "remote"  # or "local"
remote = "your-stream-id"
title = "dx Development Session"
```

## Recording Modes

### Internal Recording
Records dx TUI sessions and command output:
- Menu navigation and selections
- Command execution with full output
- File viewing and Markdown rendering
- All keyboard interactions

### External Recording  
Records external shell commands:
- Editor sessions (vim, nano, etc.)
- Interactive tools and applications
- Shell scripting and debugging
- System administration tasks

## Live Streaming

### Remote Streaming
Stream to asciinema.org or compatible services:

```bash
# Automatic URL detection and browser opening
dx --live
# Live streaming at https://asciinema.org/a/abc123
```

### Local Streaming
Stream to local network or custom servers:

```toml
[asciinema] 
stream_mode = "local"
local_addr = "127.0.0.1:9000"
```

## Status Indicators

### Recording Badge
When recording is active, dx shows a status badge:
- üî¥ **‚è∫ recording** - Session being recorded
- üì° **Streaming (remote)** - Live stream active
- üñ•Ô∏è **Streaming (local)** - Local stream active

### Visual Feedback
- Blinking red dot for live streams
- Status bar indicators
- Recording duration timers
- File path notifications

## File Management

### Automatic Naming
dx generates descriptive filenames automatically:

```
Format: {prefix}-{timestamp}.cast
Example: session-1703123456.cast
```

### Output Directory Structure
```
recordings/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ session-1703123456.cast
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build-1703123789.cast  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy-1703124012.cast
```

## Integration Features

### Menu Command Recording
Wrap any menu command with recording:

```toml
[[items]]
name = "Recorded Build"
description = "Build with session recording"
cmd = "cargo build --release"
# Automatically recorded when asciinema.external = true
```

### Relaunch Recording
Record dx updates and relaunches:

```toml
[asciinema]
on_relaunch = true      # Record update cycles
```

## Sharing and Playback

### Playback Locally
```bash
asciinema play session-1703123456.cast
```

```bash
asciinema upload session-1703123456.cast
```

### Embed in Documentation

## Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables
dx sets environment variables during recording:

```bash
echo $DX_ASCIINEMA        # "record" or "stream"
echo $DX_ASC_FILE         # Recording file path (record mode)
echo $DX_ASC_MODE         # "remote" or "local" (stream mode)
```

### Integration with CI/CD
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Record dx workflow
