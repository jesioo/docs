The MOTD (Message of the Day) system provides visual context and branding that appears above the dx interface, helping teams communicate status, instructions, and branding.

## Message of the Day

dx displays a customizable MOTD at the top of the interface, providing immediate context for anyone entering your project:

```markdown
# Welcome to Project X
```

## Markdown support

DX renders markdown in the MOTD, but sometimes complex ASCII art may not display perfectly.  

If your ASCII art looks broken, you can add `<!-- dx:ascii -->` at the top of your MOTD to disable markdown rendering and show the ASCII art exactly as written.

### ASCII Art Support
Create eye-catching project branding with ASCII art:

```text
<!-- dx:ascii -->
▗▄▄▄ ▗▖  ▗▖
▐▌  █ ▝▚▞▘ 
▐▌  █  ▐▌  
▐▙▄▄▀▗▞▘▝▚▖

Welcome to DX Project
```
