The dx menu system is the heart of your terminal workflow, allowing you to organize commands, files, and interactive forms in a hierarchical structure.

## Configuration Formats

dx supports multiple configuration formats for maximum flexibility:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TOML">
    ```toml
    [[items]]
    name = "Build Project"
    description = "Compile and build the project"
    cmd = "cargo build --release"
    alias = "build"
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="YAML">
    ```yaml
    items:
      - name: Build Project
        description: Compile and build the project
        cmd: cargo build --release
        alias: build
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="JSON">
    ```json
    {
      "items": [
        {
          "name": "Build Project",
          "description": "Compile and build the project", 
          "cmd": "cargo build --release",
          "alias": "build"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Auto-Detection

dx automatically searches for menu files in this priority order:

1. `dx.yaml`, `dx.yml`, `dx.toml`, `dx.json`
2. `menu.yaml`, `menu.yml`, `menu.toml`, `menu.json`

## Item Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Commands" icon="terminal">
    Execute shell commands with full PTY support
  </Card>
  <Card title="Files" icon="file">
    Display files with rich Markdown rendering
  </Card>
  <Card title="Nested Menus" icon="folder">
    Organize items in hierarchical structures  
  </Card>
  <Card title="Interactive Forms" icon="wpforms">
    Collect user input with dynamic field validation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Aliases for CLI Access

```bash
dx build        # Run aliased command directly
dx test         # Execute test suite 
dx aliases      # List all available aliases
```

## Advanced Features

### Nested Menu Structure
Create organized hierarchies with unlimited depth:

```toml
[[items]]
name = "Development Tools"
description = "Build, test, and deploy commands"

[[items.children]]
name = "Build Release"
cmd = "cargo build --release" 
alias = "build"

[[items.children]] 
name = "Run Tests"
cmd = "cargo test"
alias = "test"
```

### Interactive Forms
Build dynamic forms that collect input and execute commands:

```toml
[[items]]
name = "Deploy Application"
description = "Deploy to specified environment"

[items.form]
title = "Application Deployment"

[[items.form.fields]]
name = "environment"
label = "Target Environment"
type = "select"
options = ["staging", "production"]

[[items.form.fields]]
name = "version" 
label = "Version Tag"
placeholder = "v1.0.0"

[items.form]
submit = "deploy.sh {environment} {version}"
```

<Note>
  Menu configurations support environment variable expansion and can reference relative file paths for maximum flexibility.
